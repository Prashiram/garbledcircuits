public_key.txt contains n in the first line and e in the second line
private_key.txt contains n in the first line and d in the second line
ciphertext.txt contains the ciphertext
plaintext.txt contains the plaintext
deciphertext.txt contains the deciphered ciphertext

first arun keygen.py to generate e,d and n
add the desired(integer) plaintext to plaintext.txt
run encrypt.py to generate ciphertext in ciphertext.txt
run decrypt.py to generate deciphered ciphertext in deciphertext.txt
