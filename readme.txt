public_key.txt contains n in the first line and e in the second line
private_key.txt contains n in the first line and d in the second line

rsa.h contains common functions required for rsa implementation using gmp

first run keygen.c to generate e,d and n

randomx.txt is the file to store randomly generated x_0, x_1 (on the next line).
bob_c.txt is the file to be created by Shivam to generate c (generated by Bob) --> c = (x_b + k^e) mod n
strings.txt should contain two strings, one of which is to be shared by oblivious transfer
enc_messages.txt should contain m'_0 (m'_0 = m_0 - v_0) and m'_1 (m'_1 = m_1 - v_1)

first use file randomx.txt to get randomly generated x_0 and x_1 
now, generate c, store it in file bob_c.txt and upload it here
