public_key.txt contains n in the first line and e in the second line
private_key.txt contains n in the first line and d in the second line
ciphertext.txt contains the ciphertext
plaintext.txt contains the plaintext
deciphertext.txt contains the deciphered ciphertext

first run keygen.py to generate e,d and n
add the desired(integer) plaintext to plaintext.txt
run encrypt.py to generate ciphertext in ciphertext.txt
run decrypt.py to generate deciphered ciphertext in deciphertext.txt

randomx.txt is the file to store randomly generated x_0, x_1 (on the next line).
bob_c.txt is the file to be created by Shivam to generate c (generated by Bob) --> c = (x_b + k^e) mod n
strings.txt should contain two strings, one of which is to be shared by oblivious transfer
enc_messages.txt should contain m'_0 (m'_0 = m_0 - v_0) and m'_1 (m'_1 = m_1 - v_1)

first use file randomx.txt to get randomly generated x_0 and x_1 
now, generate c, store it in file bob_c.txt and upload it here
